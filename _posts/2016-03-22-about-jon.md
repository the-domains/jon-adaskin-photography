Jon's been working in photography for 25+ years. 
As a boy he would go out photographing with his father who was a painter. His father would use the photographs to paint his works. Jon learned how to use a camera from these early experiences, later, becoming very comfortable in many situations. 

Now, he specializes in (but not limited to) the fine art of Large Format Wetplate Collodion Photography.
